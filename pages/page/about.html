            Previously worked at a auto body shop, some of the tasks that I
            handled was training of new employees, prepping vehicles to get
            ready. Included with prep was preparing and learning how to do minor
            bodywork getting the vehicles a clean canvas to lay the new paint
            on. There were 2 variations of prep jobs, the first being a complete
            paintjob. That required us to take off any unnecesarry items off the
            paintable surfaces, i.e license plates, antenna's, mud-flaps etc.
            The sand paper used for those jobs ranged from 80-400, usually
            220-320 grit depending on the condition of the cars current paint.
            The other variation was a spot job which required a much finer touch
            due to the nature of the job your goal was to prep the repaired area
            with a high count grit of sand paper ranging from 400 - 800 grit
            sand paper. This also required wet sanding, that entailed grits of
            paper ranging from 800+, which would help lead to very smooth and
            clean prep surfaces.

            After time at the company I moved into the detailing portion of the
            body shop, obviously the opposite end of the prep work. After a car
            has painted and the paint has dried and sealed you would pull it out
            of the oven and begin removing the mask paper carefully, as you are
            removing the paper you would also check for imperfections in the
            paint job. This could be something such as a piece of dirt getting
            into the paint which as the detailer you would use a technique
            called
            <span style="color: red"> Denib and Polish </span>
            Which was taking an extremely high grit count sand paper
            <span style="color: blue">(around 1400+)</span>
            and sanding off that imperfection and then buffing and polishing the
            spot of the fix. <br /><br />You would also get the car prepared for
            the customer to pickup, that was usually involving cleaning windows,
            chrome, and rims with steel wool for any paint over spray that may
            have gotten through the masking paper. Then wash the car, vacuum and
            make it look like it is ready for the showroom
